# redENGINE - FiveM
This is just a FiveM Cheat UI remade by me, it looks exactly like the real thing so have fun doing what ever lol

<h1> Fixes:
  <li> If you're having trouble loading the project, please do the following
  <li> 1. Click on the "redENGINE UI" project and then click add existing project
  <li> 2. Goto the folder where you have "redENGINE_FiveM", then open the folder
  <li> 3. Then Double Click on "ImGui DirectX 11 Kiero Hook.vcxproj", once you've done that, you should be able to see the project
</h1>

<h1>
  Setup:
  <li> 1. Download This Entire Source and put "rE.png" in your "C" or "D" drive.
  <li> 2. Open the .sln file and goto "main.cpp" and goto line "97" and change the filepath of the image to its path.
  <li> 3. Compile as x64 (Release) and inject into FiveM.
  <li> 4. Have fun and enjoy!
